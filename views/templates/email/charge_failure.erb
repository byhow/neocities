Hello,

We're writing to let you know that Neocities has had an issue charging your card. We will try again automatically in a few days, but we just wanted to give you a heads up in case something is wrong with your card.

We will retry over the next few weeks. If we can't make a successful charge, we will automatically switch your account over to the free plan.

If you need to change the card on file, you can do so on your account settings page.

Thank you!

The Neocities Team
