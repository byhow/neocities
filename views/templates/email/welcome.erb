Hello <%= @site.username %>, and welcome to Neocities!

Neocities is a community for people that make web sites, and you're now a member!

Making your first (or your latest) web site is a powerful thing. Unlike traditional social networks where you have no control over how your content is displayed, here you can create any kind of site you want, fill it with the content that matters to you, and share that site with everyone in the world. All you have to do is give out your web site address (<%= @site.host %>) for people to see your creation!

Since you're new, we've put together a basic "hello world" page for you. Now all you need to do is login and edit your "index.html" file, and you're on your way to being a webmaster of your own site on the World Wide Web!

If you have any questions or comments, or just want to say hi, feel free to contact us at https://neocities.org/contact. You can also reach us on Bluesky at @neocities.org. We're super busy, so we can't always help with everything, but if you have a problem with the site or a bug to report, we'll try our best to look into it.

Neocities doesn't have investors, doesn't put ads on your site, and doesn't sell your data to marketing companies. Instead, all of our funding comes directly from Neocities users just like you. If you would like to help our mission to help save the creative web from the smoldering tire fire that is modern social media, please consider becoming a supporter. You can do so at any time at https://neocities.org/supporter

From Penelope (the Neocities cat), the Neocities Team, and on behalf of all our sites, our very best wishes for you (and your awesome web site). We can't wait to see what it looks like!

Best,
The Neocities Team
